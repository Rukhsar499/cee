        <p>Thank you for choosing us as your design partner. [cite: 5]</p>

        <h2>Designing Process</h2>
        <p>We at CEE BEE Design Studio adopt a comprehensive, phased approach to every project, ensuring clarity,
            creativity, and best outcomes for your space.</p>

        <h3>Initial Client Consultation</h3>
        <p>The process starts with a detailed client meeting. In this onboarding session, we gather your vision, discuss
            the scope, wish list, and clarify your functional needs and desired aesthetics.</p>
        <p><strong>Discussion Points:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Define project scope (areas involved, room usage, goals)</li>
            <li>Identify client lifestyle, style preferences, and usage patterns </li>
            <li>Establish project objectives and budget alignment</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Site Survey and Technical Assessment</h3>
        <p>We conduct a precise site survey, recording measurements and existing conditions through photographs and,
            where needed, inviting technical consultants or trades to ensure accuracy.</p>
        <p><strong>Includes:</strong> </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Detailed measurement and documentation of all spaces </li>
            <li>Site access for company representatives or trades </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Preliminary Cost Estimate</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Once the layout is finalised, we provide indicative budget estimates based on projected requirements.
            </li>
            <li>This estimation may change once all materials and selections are finalized.</li>
            <li>Estimates are preliminary and may be revised after design sign-off and material selection</li>
            <li>Once the layout is finalized, we provide indicative budget estimates based on the projected
                requirements.</li>
            <li>These estimates are preliminary and may be revised after design sign-off and final selection of
                materials. </li>
            <li>Before starting the 3D design, we discuss the initial concept-based estimate with the client to explain
                that costs may vary depending on design and material decisions.</li>
            <li>Obtaining formal approval of this estimate ensures greater budget clarity, helping clients understand
                where incremental costs arise and aligning expectations before proceeding.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Design Concept Presentation (Story Board)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Along with the detailed furniture layout, we will also share a storyboard corresponding to the proposed
                design. </li>
            <li>This will be provided in a PPT format to help you clearly understand the concepts and ideas we have
                shortlisted for your property. </li>
            <li>This will also include a clear explanation to help you understand the aesthetics and overall look we
                intend to propose.</li>
            <li>Each area of the property will feature multiple concept images, giving you a range of options to choose
                the most suitable one. </li>
            <li>The concepts will span various design styles such as Modern, Traditional, Country Style, European, and
                more.</li>
        </ul>
